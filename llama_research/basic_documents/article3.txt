Barry Silbert resigns from Grayscale board

New SEC filings have revealed that Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert and president Mark Murphy have resigned from the board of Grayscale Investments, the organization behind the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and a subsidiary of DCG.
Grayscale is in the midst of an application process with the SEC for approval to convert the trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. This has been an ongoing effort by Grayscale, and has been denied before.

DCG, meanwhile, is in the middle of financial difficulties and ongoing legal battles, including a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General alleging a $1 billion fraud by DCG and its Genesis subsidiary. The lawsuit from the NYAG also names Silbert personally.
