In Baldur's Gate 2, the player character wakes up in a dungeon and is freed by their half-sister Imoen. They learn that they have been captured by a man named Jon Irenicus, who has also imprisoned their other party members. The group escapes to the city of Athkatla and seeks help to rescue their sister. They choose to align with either the Shadow Thieves guild or the vampire Bodhi. Regardless of their choice, they eventually confront Irenicus at Spellhold, where he has been conducting experiments on Imoen. During the confrontation, Irenicus rips the player character's soul from their body and grants Imoen's soul to his sister Bodhi. The player character turns into the Slayer, the avatar of Bhaal, and forces Irenicus and Bodhi to retreat to the Underdark. The player character fights their way to the surface, kills Bodhi, restores Imoen's soul, and enters the elven city of Suldanessellar, which has been taken over by Irenicus. They defeat Irenicus and retrieve their soul, but he drags them to the Nine Hells. In a final encounter, the player character and their party defeat Irenicus, retrieve their soul, and return to the realms as heroes.
