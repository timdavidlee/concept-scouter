Do Kwon reportedly to be extradited to the United States

Do Kwon, founder of the collapsed Terra/Luna project, will be extradited from Montenegro to the United States once he's completed his four-month-long jail sentence for document forgery, says the Wall Street Journal. Although a Montenegrin court had already approved his extradition, it left the decision of whether to send him to South Korea or the United States up to Justice Minister Andrej Milovic. Milovic has reportedly privately said he intends to send Kwon to the US.
Kwon filed a last-ditch appeal of the extradition decision on December 6. A decision is scheduled on the matter by December 15. Milovic is unlikely to publicly announce Kwon's extradition destination until then.

Both South Korea and the United States have sought Kwon's extradition on criminal charges related to the Terra/Luna scheme. Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York indicted Kwon on eight fraud and market manipulation charges in March 2023. He and his company also face a civil lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
