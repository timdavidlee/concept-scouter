Game: Divinity Original Sin 2

Setting
Like other games in the series, Divinity: Original Sin II is set in the medieval fantasy world of Rivellon, and takes place centuries after Divinity: Original Sin. The story starts some years after the passing of Lucian, a Human who possessed unrivaled power and was revered by the people of Rivellon as the "Divine", the chosen one of the "Seven", the deities of Rivellon's main religion. Rivellon is currently plagued by the Voidwoken, monstrous creatures of mysterious origins who attack all other living things, and whose threat has greatly increased following Lucian's passing.

Among the people of Rivellon, Sourcerers are individuals born with the talent of manipulating a form of energy known as Source, which they can use to cast powerful spells; however, the use of Source attracts the Voidwoken, leading Sourcerers to become feared and reviled. The Divine Order, founded by Lucian, therefore dedicated one of its factions, the Magisters, to capture or kill all Sourcerers; the captured are sent to Fort Joy, a prison-town on Reaper's Eye, an island previously inhabited by Braccus Rex,[Note 1] the late "Source King" and former tyrannical ruler of Rivellon. The Magisters are led by Bishop Alexandar, Lucian's son who claims to be the new Divine, along with his advisor Dallis.

The player character is a Sourcerer, who can either be created from scratch by the player, or be one of six pre-made characters, all of whom can also be recruited as part of the player character's party: Beast, a male Dwarf hellbent on ending the reign of his cousin Justinia, the Dwarf Queen; Fane, a male and the undead-looking last member of a long-forgotten immortal species, who spent aeons imprisoned and now seeks to discover what happened to the rest of his kind; Ifan ben-Mezd, a male Human who is a former friend of Lucian and former member of the Divine Order, now part of a group of mercenaries known as the Lone Wolves; Lohse, a female Human seeking freedom from a mysterious and powerful demon inside her gaining more control every day; the Red Prince, a male Lizard originally destined to become a leader among his people, but who was banished due to dealings with a demon and now aims to regain his royal position; and Sebille, a female Elf and former slave looking for revenge against her former Lizard masters.

Plot
The player character, a Sourcerer, is captured by the Divine Order and transported to the island prison Fort Joy on the ship Merryweather. The ship is attacked and sunk by a gigantic Kraken Voidwoken; however, the player character is saved from drowning by a mysterious force, whose voice calls them "Godwoken". On Fort Joy, the Godwoken witnesses the brutal regime of the Magisters led by Alexandar and Dallis, who frequently "purge" prisoners of their Source, turning them into mindless husks they use as a fighting force. After escaping Fort Joy, the Godwoken meets the Seekers, a group looking for Sourcerers with the potential of becoming the new Divine. The Godwoken also visits the Hall of Echoes, where they encounter one of the Seven. The God, who reveals themselves as the one who rescued the Godwoken earlier, explains that the Veil, a magical barrier separating Rivellon and the Void, is weakening and allowing the Voidwoken to enter Rivellon, draining the Seven's Source. The God urges the Godwoken to fulfill their potential, ascend to Divinity and hold back the Void before it kills the Seven. With the help of the Seekers and the half-demon Malady, the Godwoken escapes from Reaper's Eye after defeating Alexandar and stealing his sentient ship, the Lady Vengeance.

The Lady Vengeance is attacked by Dallis and her right-hand man Vredeman, who kill most of the Seekers; although the ship manages a narrow escape thanks to Malady. The Godwoken sails to the island of Reaper's Coast, where they unlock their Source powers. Their God later directs the Godwoken to the Well of Ascension, where they can absorb enough Source to become Divine. They also learn that Dallis has excavated the Aeteran, an artifact able to purge all Source from Rivellon. The Godwoken meets Aeterna, a being who claims to be member of an immortal race called Eternals, the original inhabitants of Rivellon. The Godwoken learns that the Seven are in fact Eternals who craved power, and betrayed the rest of their species by banishing them to the Void. The Seven then created the mortal races of Rivellon, and posed as deities to maintain their own power by draining Source from them.

The Godwoken sails to the Nameless Isle, where the Well of Ascension is located. There, they learn that the Voidwoken are what became of the Eternals cast into the Void, and that God King, also the leader of the Voidwoken, is the Eternals' former king. The God King and the Voidwoken intend to return to Rivellon, and reclaim it as theirs. After a final encounter with Alexandar, the Godwoken reaches the Well, but before they can become Divine, Dallis appears and destroys the Well with the Aeteran. The Godwoken's failure enrages their God, who becomes blind with fury and attacks them; the Godwoken defeats them in battle, killing all of the Seven in the process.

The Godwoken travels to the city of Arx, which has come under siege by Voidwoken. Tracking Dallis and Vredeman to the tomb of Lucian, they find Lucian alive within, who reveals that he faked his death and that he, not the Void, had been draining Source from the Seven. Lucian intends to purge all Source from Rivellon and use it to permanently seal the Veil, forever keeping the Voidwoken away at the cost of all Source in the world. Dallis, secretly an Eternal, has been aiding Lucian behind Alexandar's back with the help of Vredeman, in truth a resurrected Braccus Rex Dallis turned into a reluctant slave.

Braccus Rex breaks free of Dallis's control and summons the Kraken to attack the Godwoken, Lucian, and Dallis. After defeating them, the player is presented with four final choices: become the new Divine and the most powerful being of Rivellon; fulfil Lucian's wish and purge all Source from Rivellon to forever seal the Voidwoken away; release the Source and the powers of Divinity to the world so all the beings in Rivellon become Divine; or allows the God King to return to Rivellon, restoring Eternal rule.
